A Compiler for a pascal look alike programming language.
For the project we had to develop both the front end and back end of the compiler.
For the front end we used the SableCC library which is a LALR(1) parser and creates automatically
the concrete and abstract syntax tree based on the grammar that was given.

The Abstract syntax tree was translated to an Intermediate language so itâ€™s easier to be transformed to final x86 code.
After the intermediate level code we developed some  optimization at block level as well as function level to improve the code.
At the back end part we converted the intermediate code to the final executable x86 code.
